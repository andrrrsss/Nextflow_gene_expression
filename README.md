## Nextflow Gene Expression Pipeline

This pipeline is designed to process and analyze RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. The pipeline utilizes Nextflow, a high-performance workflow tool that allows for easy and reproducible data processing. The steps involved in the pipeline are as follows:

1. Quality control and trimming of raw sequencing reads: This step involves checking the quality of raw sequencing data and trimming low-quality regions.

2. Mapping reads: In this step, reads are aligned by KALISTO (pseudoalignment.

By using Nextflow, this pipeline can be easily run on a local workstation or a high-performance computing cluster, allowing for efficient and scalable processing of large scRNA-seq datasets. The pipeline can be easily adapted or extended to include additional steps or tools as needed.
